# create-next-quick

**create-next-quick** is a CLI tool that lets you instantly create a new Next.js project with your choice of options.

## Why create-next-quick?

`create-next-quick` is a lightweight and fast alternative to `create-next-app`. It provides an interactive setup process that lets you choose the options you want for your project, such as TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and the Next.js app directory. It also lets you create multiple pages at once, which can save you a lot of time when starting a new project.

- **Next.js App Directory** â€” support for the new Next.js app directory.
- **Custom Page Generation** â€” create multiple pages at once.
- **Linter Support** â€” choose between ESLint and Biome.
- **Shadcn UI** â€” automatically install and configure Shadcn UI.
- **Clean Project Setup** â€” removes default favicon and clears public folder.

## Installation

You donâ€™t need to install it globally â€” run it instantly with `npx`:

```bash
